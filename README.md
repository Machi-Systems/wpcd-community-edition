# About WPCloudDeploy #

**WPCloudDeploy is a WordPress plugin that allows you to easily deploy servers at major cloud-server providers and then install apps (such as WordPress) on those servers.  And it does it from inside the familiar WordPress wp-admin dashboard.**

![WPCloudDeploy Dashboard](https://wpclouddeploy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/server-list-without-slate-theme-01.png)

The plugin makes it easy to deploy servers at well-known providers such as DigitalOcean, Linode, Vultr, AWS, Google Cloud and more.

**It is primarily used to install and manage WordPress servers and sites.** 

![WPCloudDeploy Dashboard](https://wpclouddeploy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/wpcd-v4-095.png)

Its extensible model allow developers to add new apps in the future.

All management features are available inside of wp-admin on your WordPress site.  Apart from your cloud server provider(s), you do not need a 3rd party SaaS service to manage your servers and sites.

## Getting Started: The Easier Way ##

The easiest way to get started is to use the [pre-configured droplet at digital ocean.](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/wpclouddeploy)

Just deploy the droplet, login with your ssh credentials and follow the instructions to setup your domain and other info.

Then follow the [getting started documentation on the WPCloudDeploy site](https://wpclouddeploy.com/documentation/wpcloud-deploy/introduction-to-wpcloud-deploy/).

These instructions will help you create ssh keys, api keys and connect to your account at DigitalOcean.

## Getting Started: The Less Easier Way ##

Alternatively, you can download the zip file from here and install it like you would any other WordPress plugin. You will need to tweak your webserver so check out [the pre-requisites](https://wpclouddeploy.com/documentation/wpcloud-deploy/requirements/) before going down this road.

Then, to install WordPress servers and sites, follow the [getting started documentation on the WPCloudDeploy site](https://wpclouddeploy.com/documentation/wpcloud-deploy/introduction-to-wpcloud-deploy/)

## Plugin Features ##

Features of the plugin include:

* APP: WordPress - **EXTENSIVE** support for deploying and managing WordPress servers and sites from inside the WordPress admin dashboard. This is the primary app type that this plugin supports.  
* Integrated DigitalOcean Cloud Provider.
* Extensible server provider model supports EC2, LIGHTSAIL, LINODE, VULTR, UPCLOUD, HETZNER, EXOSCALE, AZURE, GOOGLE CLOUD and other public and private cloud providers via additional plugins.
* Extra App: OpenVPN - includes front-end purchase and management. This helps developers to see how multiple apps can potentially co-exist inside the framework.
* Extra App: Basic Server - deploy simple servers with no additional apps pre-installed. This helps developers to see how multiple apps can potentially co-exist inside the framework.

## About Branches ##

We generally use two branches - the MAIN branch is the most stable version and is suitable for use in a production environment.

The DEV branch is usually stable but not all existing features have been fully regression tested.

If you are starting a project of your own and you'd like to start with a version containing all the latest features, you can usually use the DEV branch.  

The DEV branch is usually promoted to the MAIN branch every 30 to 60 days.

We commit EVERYTHING to our repository so there is no pesky build process necessary.  You can just download the zip from either branch and upload to your WordPress site using the ADD NEW option in the WordPress plugins screen.

## Plugin History ##

Development was started in 2019 and the first release to the public became available in March 2020.  Since then there have been numerous updates, with an average pace of one update per month.
The plugin was always open-source but until October 2021, the source was only available to purchasers.

In October 2021, Version 4.10.8 was pushed to a public Github repository.  Now, anyone can just install the core plugin and immediately get WordPress server management functions that rival SaaS systems.

Note: Even though the entire git development history isn't available on github, the change log below still reflects the full release history.
